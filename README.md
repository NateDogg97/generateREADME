  ## Description

  This project uses node.js to generate a high quality README from several user inputs. My motivation for the project was to save time writing READMEs and spend more time writing code. I built this project so that everyone can use this application to save time and to help make more proffesional READMEs This project helps solve the problem of too few high quality READMEs on Github. Hopefully mroe people will have high quality READMEs after installing this application. I learned a lttle but about using the terminal for coding and a little but about node.js.
